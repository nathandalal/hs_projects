rem Program Overview and Implementation:
rem This program, given a grid size, will generate a grid of dots.
rem The program will prompt the user for a grid size. Then it will create a 2d array with rem the grid size as the square length. It will then call the dot-filling subroutine and
rem after that, it will call the grid printing subroutine.

rem BASIC Code:

401 input "grid size";m :rem user input of grid size
402 if m<0 then goto 401 :rem check if grid size is valid
403 dim gr$(m,m) :rem create 2d array of strings
404 gosub 421 :rem fill array with dots subroutine
405 gosub 451 :rem printing grid subroutine
406 end

421 rem filling 2d array with dots subroutine
422 for i=1 to m
423 for j=1 to m
424 gr$(i,j) = "."
425 next j
426 next i
427 return

451 rem printing grid subroutine
452 for i=1 to m :rem outer loop
453 for j=1 to m :rem inner loop
454 print gr$(i,j);" "; :rem print next part
455 next j
456 print :rem goes to next line (formatting)
457 next i
458 return :rem exit printing grid subroutine
