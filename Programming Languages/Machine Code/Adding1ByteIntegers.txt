Program Description:
This code will add 1 byte integers stored in memory and store them in a 1 byte memory location.

Variables:
B1 = $0410 //byte 1 to be added
B2 = $0411 //byte 2 to be added
A1 = $0412 //byte where answer will be stored

Because of the chipâ€™s Little Indian method of understanding the bytes, translation of locations in memory will be written in low-byte to high-byte order. This is why B1 is translated as 10 04 instead of 04 10.

Instructions:

CLC      18       //Clear the carry flag.
LDA B1   AD 10 04 //Load the accumulator with the value in location hex B1.
ADC B2   6D 11 04 //Add with carry the value in location hex B2 in accumulator.
STA A1   8D 12 04 //Store the value in the accumulator in location hex A1. 
BRK      00	  //Break.

Paste-able Code (enter in hex 0500 to 050a):
18 AD 10 04 6D 11 04 8D
12 04 00

Enter bytes you would like added in B1 and B2 and the sum will be stored in A1 after you run the program.
